--~~ Less for Rails ~~--

A plug-and-play hook for the fabulous Less CSS syntax, http://lesscss.org/.






              -- Usage --
       
      1. Install the gem, `gem install less`       
      2. Install the plugin, 
        `script/plugin install git://github.com/augustl/less-for-rails.git`
      3. Create public/stylesheets/yourfile.less
      4. Use <%= stylesheet_link_tag "yourfile" %> in the views, as normal.
      
      It will generate one .css for each .less
      in public/stylesheets.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    -- It knows about production mode --
    
          In production mode, it only compiles the CSS when
          the application boots.
          
          In development mode, it compiles the CSS all the
          time, so that you can edit your .less and reload
          the site to see how it looks. It is very fabolous,
          and the plugin has won many prizes for this.
          
          
          
          
                          -- Git --
                          
                      Are you using Less for all your stylesheets? Perhaps
                      you should add `public/stylesheets/*.css` to your
                      .gitignore.
          
          
          
          -- Using it in hazardous environments --
          
          Some hosts, such as Heroku, doesn't allow the creation of static
          files. This plugin creates static files. Crash!
          
          There's another edition of this plugin that uses cache control
          headers through controllers, which works out of the box on
          Heroku.
