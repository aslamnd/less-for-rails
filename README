--~~ Less for Rails ~~--

A plug-and-play hook for the fabulous Less CSS syntax, http://lesscss.org/.






              -- Usage --
              
      1. Install the plugin
      2. Create public/stylesheets/yourfile.less
      3. As normal, use <%= stylesheet_link_tag "yourfile" %> in
         the views
      
      
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    -- It knows about production mode --
    
          In production mode, it only compiles the CSS when
          the application boots.
          
          In development mode, it compiles the CSS all the
          time, so that you can edit your .less and reload
          the site to see how it looks. It is very fabolous,
          and the plugin has won many prizes for this.
